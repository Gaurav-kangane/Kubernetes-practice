step-1 Go to console and search for EKS(Elastic Kubernetes Service) 
step-2 create cluster after that click on created cluster and go to compute option create nodegroup 
step-3 After nodegroup available go to ec2 you can see nodes are running.

step-4 For accessing them create 1 ec2 instance and connect it and install kubernetes below command for installation
         curl -o kubectl https://amazon-eks.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1.19.6/2021-01-05/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
   chmod +x ./kubectl
   mv ./kubectl /usr/local/bin 
   kubectl version --short --client

step-6 run aws configure and enter you secret access key and credentials after that run below command
       aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name <cluster name>

step-7 Run below command for checking how many nodes are running
       ***** kubectl get nodes

There are 3 types of workloads are present
1. pod
2. ReplicaSet
3. Deployment
These all are running on nodes

step-8 create pod.yml file inside write this
        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Pod
        metadata:
          name: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
*********************************************

step-9 Run file command = kubectl apply -f pod.yml
      to check how many pod running =  kubectl get pods

    There is a drawback of pod workload is you can't create replicas to overcome this issue kubernetes have ReplicaSet workload lets create this file
replicaset.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: web-rs
spec:
  replicas: 3 # 3 Pods should exist at all times.
  selector:  # Pods label should be defined in ReplicaSet label selector
    matchLabels:
      app: webapp
  template:
    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: webapp
        type: front-end # Atleast 1 Pod label should match with ReplicaSet Label Selector
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx-container
        image: httpd
********************************************************************************************************
Run below commands after creating yml file
kubectl apply -f replicaset.yml
kubectl get pods  

There is a disadvantage in replicaset workload that is you can't change image in yml file 
If you created httpd image later you want to change to nginx you cant' do this action 
To overcome this issue kubernets have Deployment workload.



step-10 Create deployment.yml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: httpd
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 

************************************************************
Run below commands for run yml file
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl get pods

In deployment workload you can change image
i.e If you want to change image from httpd to nginx you can do it. After updating yml file run apply command
