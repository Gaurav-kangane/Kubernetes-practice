1. Service Account =  A ServiceAccount is an identity used by pods and applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster to talk to the Kubernetes API server.

**Why Service Accounts are needed
1.Pods may need to:
    Read ConfigMaps or Secrets
    List or watch Pods
    Create or update resources
    Call Kubernetes APIs securely

2.Service Accounts provide:
    Authentication (who you are)
    Authorization (what you’re allowed to do via RBAC)

Conclusion
🔹 ServiceAccount → Used by pods to interact with the API.
🔹 Role & RoleBinding → Grants permissions to the ServiceAccount.
🔹 Attach to Pod → Use serviceAccountName in the pod spec.

2. OIDC (OpenID Connect) is how Kubernetes lets users authenticate using an external identity provider
   OIDC is a way for Kubernetes to know who you are when you try to access a cluster.

Think of it like this
    Kubernetes = office building
    OIDC provider = security gate (Google, Azure, etc.)
    RBAC = permission rules inside the building

    You first prove who you are at the gate.
    Kubernetes then checks what you are allowed to do.

What happens step by step
    You run a kubectl command.
    You log in using your company login (SSO).
    You get a short-lived token.
    Kubernetes checks the token and trusts it.
    RBAC decides if you can view pods, create deployments, etc.

Why people use OIDC
    No username/password inside Kubernetes
    Same login as email or company account
    Easy to manage users and teams
    More secure than shared kubeconfig files

Very important point
    OIDC = authentication (who you are)
    RBAC = authorization (what you can do)
