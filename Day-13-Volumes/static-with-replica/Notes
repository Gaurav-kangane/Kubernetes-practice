**StatefulSet in Kubernetes
      A StatefulSet is used for stateful applications where identity, storage, and order matter. Think databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Kafka, or Zookeeper.

**Key features
1. Stable Pod Identity

    Pod names are predictable
    app-0, app-1, app-2
    
    If a pod restarts, it comes back with the same name


2. Stable Network Identity

    Each pod gets a stable DNS name
    
    Works with a Headless Service

Example:  app-0.app-headless.default.svc.cluster.local



3. Persistent Storage per Pod

    Each pod gets its own PVC
    
    PVC is not deleted even if the pod is deleted
    
    Data stays attached to the same pod identity

4. Ordered Pod Management

    Pods are created one by one
    
    Pods are terminated in reverse order
    
    Useful for leader-follower or master-slave systems

2. Headless Service =
      Headless Service in Kubernetes
      A Headless Service is a service without a cluster IP. Instead of load balancing traffic, it directly exposes pod IPs using DNS.

Why it is called “headless”
    Normal Service → has a ClusterIP
    
    Headless Service → no ClusterIP
    
    DNS returns pod IPs, not a single virtual IP
    
    clusterIP: None


What problem it solves
    Needed when each pod must be contacted directly
    
    Required for StatefulSet
    
    Useful for databases, leader–follower systems, and peer discovery

practicle =

1. In pv.yml file 3 persistent volumes are created because we have 3 replicas, assume our app is mysql we are not using clusterIp we are using headless service.

2. In statefulset.yml for easy understanding pod name, we are using it.

3. Apply all file --> kubectl apply -f .

4. kubectl get pods --> all the pods are creating one by one

5. kubectl get pv --> all the pv created and bounded

6. kubectl get pvc --> all the pvc bounded to pv

7. If we delete any pod it will recreate and bound to same pv. 

8. If we delete the pod storage is not going to delete it will bound to new pod.
