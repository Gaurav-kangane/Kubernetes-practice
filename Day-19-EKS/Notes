Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)
    Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service from Amazon Web Services. 
    It helps you run, scale, and manage Docker containers without needing to manage your own orchestration platform like Kubernetes.

Core components
1. Cluster

    A cluster is a logical group where your containers run.
    It can use:    
    EC2 instances that you manage, or
    Fargate, where AWS manages the servers for you.

2. Task Definition

    This is the blueprint of your application.
    It defines:
    
    Container image (from ECR or Docker Hub)
    
    CPU and memory
    
    Port mappings
    
    Environment variables
    
    IAM role
    
    Logging configuration

    Volumes

3. Task
    A task is a running instance of a task definition.
    
    One task can have one or more containers.
    
    Tasks can be run one time (batch jobs) or continuously.

4. Service
    A service keeps a specified number of tasks running all the time.
    
    Handles restarts if a task fails
    
    Integrates with load balancers
    
    Supports rolling updates and auto scaling
    
    Used mainly for long-running applications like APIs and web apps.

5. Launch types
    EC2 launch type
    
    You manage EC2 instances
    
    More control over instance types, AMIs, networking
    
    Slightly cheaper at large scale
    
    You are responsible for patching and capacity planning
