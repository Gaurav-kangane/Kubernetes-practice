1. Create EKS cluster and add the add-ons "Amazon EBS CSI DRIVER" because The EBS CSI Driver allows Kubernetes to create, attach, detach, 
   and delete Amazon EBS volumes dynamically for pods.

2. create nodegroup use c7i-flex.large instance type

3. create ec2 and install kubectl and configure aws keys and then aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --Name Gsk  

4. create all the file required for dynamic volume like configmap, secret, storageclass and stateful.

5. Apply all files kubectl apply -f . --> you will see pod is creating one by one i.e first one create after second and third.

6. kubectl get pv --> you will see volume     and    kubectl get pvc --> volume claim will be there

7. In storageclass file --> provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com = AWS EBS CSI driver 

8. volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer --> means The volume is NOT created when the PVC is created  and 
                                               The volume is created only after a Pod that uses the PVC is scheduled

9. volumeBindingMode: Immediate  --> means volume will create it does not depends on pod will create or not.

10. reclaimPolicy: Delete  --> if we delete the pvc the volume will be deleted  --> kubectl delete pvc <pvc-name>  --> kubectl get pvc (for pvc name)

11. reclaimPolicy: Retain --> if we delete the pvc the volume will remain kept 


12. In configmap file we are storing the database name , database user we are storing non sensitive data because we don't want to hardcore the
    all details in statefulset file.

13. In secret file we are storing root password, user password because it is sensitive data. In statefulset file we are calling the passwords from this file.
