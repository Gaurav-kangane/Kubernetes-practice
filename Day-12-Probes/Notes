1. Startup Probe
    Purpose: Checks if the application has started successfully.
    Until this passes, liveness and readiness probes are disabled.
    
    Use it for apps with long startup time.


2. Readiness Probe

    Purpose: Checks if the application is ready to serve traffic.
    If it fails, the pod is removed from Service endpoints, but not restarted.
    
    Use it when startup is slow or during temporary failures like DB reconnect.


3. Liveness Probe

    Purpose: Checks if the application is alive.
    If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
    
    Use it when your app can hang or get stuck.
    
    Example use case:
    App is running but not responding due to a deadlock.

practicle = 

startup.yml
1. we are taking nodeapp image for this practicle it is also added in this repo and pushing to ECR

2. Create Startup.yml file path we are giving default in default path our application is running. --> kubectl apply -f startup.yml

3. kubectl get pods --> pod is running 1/1 then do some changes in path give any name e.g path: /start

4. kubectl delete -f startup.yml and apply again --> kubectl apply -f startup.yml

5. kubectl get pods --> you will see app status is 0/1 after 60 sec the pod will restart again because failureThreshold: 5 it will restart
   till 5 and then it will go to CrashLoopBackOff state.


readiness.yml
1. In our yml file if apply it --> kubectl apply -f readiness.yml --> pod will creates successfully 

2. kubectl get pods --> pod 1/1 running status --> because path we have give it is correct path. --> kubectl get endpoints --> check that for pod endpoint is created or not.

3. If we do changes in path e.g /hello then --> kubectl delete -f readinesss.yml --> and apply again kubectl apply -f readinesss.yml

4. kubectl get pods --> pod will in 0/1 state and it will not restart the pod.

5. kubectl get endpoints --> no endpoints is created for pod.
