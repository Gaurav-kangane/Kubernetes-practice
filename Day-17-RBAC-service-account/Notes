1. Service Account =  A ServiceAccount is an identity used by pods and applications running inside a Kubernetes cluster to talk to the Kubernetes API server.

**Why Service Accounts are needed
1.Pods may need to:
    Read ConfigMaps or Secrets
    List or watch Pods
    Create or update resources
    Call Kubernetes APIs securely

2.Service Accounts provide:
    Authentication (who you are)
    Authorization (what you’re allowed to do via RBAC)

Conclusion
🔹 ServiceAccount → Used by pods to interact with the API.
🔹 Role & RoleBinding → Grants permissions to the ServiceAccount.
🔹 Attach to Pod → Use serviceAccountName in the pod spec.
