Helm =
  Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes.

Just like:

  yum installs software on Linux
  
  npm installs Node packages

👉 Helm installs and manages Kubernetes applications.


Helm is like Terraform modules for Kubernetes and it contains all configuration files such as Deployment and Service, and we mainly change the values.yaml file to define image, service type, 
and replica count for an application.

1. `helm create hotstar` creates a **hotstar** directory with all Kubernetes configuration templates.
2. Modify `values.yaml` to add the Docker image, change service type from ClusterIP to NodePort, and set replica count.
3. `helm install app1 hotstar` installs the application where **app1** is the release name and **hotstar** is the chart name.
4. `kubectl get pods` is used to verify whether the pods are running.
5.  After updating `values.yaml`, run `helm upgrade app1 hotstar` to apply the changes.
6. `helm uninstall app1` removes the application and all related Kubernetes resources.
