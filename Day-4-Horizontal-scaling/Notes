Horizontal Scaling =

Horizontal scaling in Kubernetes means increasing or decreasing the number of pod replicas based on load. 
Kubernetes does this using something called the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA).

What horizontal scaling really means

      More traffic → more pods
      
      Less traffic → fewer pods
      
      No changes to pod size or resources
      
      Scaling happens automatically based on metrics
      
      This is different from vertical scaling, where you increase CPU or memory of a pod.


Practicle
1. Run Deploy.yml --> kubectl apply -f Deploy.yml
2. Run service.yml --> kubectl apply -f service.yml
3. Run hpa.yml     --> kubectl apply -f hpa.yml

4. run command --> kubectl get svc --> and copy loadbalancer url 
5. run test.sh --> sh test.sh --> before running test file change loadbalancer url
      test.sh is created for to increase cpu load 
6. check the pod cpu load --> kubectl top pod
7. check how many pods creating --> kubectl get pods
