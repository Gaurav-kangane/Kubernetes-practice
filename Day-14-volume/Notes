Storage Class =
    A StorageClass defines how storage is created dynamically in Kubernetes.
    You don’t create disks manually.
    Kubernetes creates them on demand using the StorageClass.


1.provisioner =
    Defines who creates the volume.
    Examples:
      ebs.csi.aws.com → AWS EBS
      
      efs.csi.aws.com → AWS EFS
      
      kubernetes.io/gce-pd → GCP Disk
      
      rancher.io/local-path → Local storage


2.volumeBindingMode =
    Controls when the volume is created.
    
    Immediate=
      1.Volume created as soon as PVC is created
      2.Can cause AZ mismatch
    
    WaitForFirstConsumer (Best practice) 
      1.Volume created only after Pod is scheduled
      2.Volume is created in same AZ as node


3.reclaimPolicy
    Controls what happens to the volume after PVC deletion.
    when you use policy = delete the volume will be deleted after pvc deletion
    when you use policy = retain the volume will be kept after pvc deletion  (production recommanded)

1.Configmap = 
    A ConfigMap is used to store non-sensitive configuration data.
    Think of it like:
      App settings that can change without rebuilding the image.

    Examples:
        App port
        Environment name
        Database host (not password)
        Feature flags
        App config files


2. Secret = 
    A Secret is used to store sensitive data securely.
    Think of it like:
      Passwords and keys that your app needs, but should not be hardcoded.
    Examples:
        Database passwords
        API keys
        Tokens
        TLS certificates
