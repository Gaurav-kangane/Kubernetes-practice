Ingress =
  Ingress is the Kubernetes way to manage external HTTP and HTTPS traffic and route it to services inside the cluster. 
  Think of it as a smart entry gate that decides where requests should go based on rules.

**Why Ingress is used
    Without Ingress, you usually expose apps using:
    NodePort: Opens ports on every node.
    LoadBalancer: Creates one cloud load balancer per service.

**Ingress solves this by:
    Using one load balancer
    Routing to multiple services
    Supporting path-based and host-based routing
    Handling TLS termination in one place
