What are resources?
  Resources mean CPU and memory that a container needs to run.
  CPU is measured in cores or millicores
    1 CPU = 1 core
    500m = half a core

Memory is measured in Mi, Gi  
  256Mi, 512Mi, 1Gi, etc.

ex.
resources:
  requests:
    cpu: "250m"
    memory: "256Mi"
  limits:
    cpu: "500m"
    memory: "512Mi"

Meaning:
  1.Pod is scheduled only if a node has at least 250m CPU and 256Mi memory
  2.Container can scale up to 500m CPU and 512Mi memory
  3.More than 512Mi memory → container restarts

What happens in real scenarios?
  Request set, limit not set
  Pod gets guaranteed minimum
  Can use extra resources if node is free

Limit set, request not set
  Kubernetes auto-sets request = limit
  Can cause scheduling issues

Memory exceeds limit
  Container is killed (OOMKilled)

CPU exceeds limit
  Container is throttled, not killed
