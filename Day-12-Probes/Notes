1. Startup Probe
    Purpose: Checks if the application has started successfully.
    Until this passes, liveness and readiness probes are disabled.
    
    Use it for apps with long startup time.


2. Readiness Probe

    Purpose: Checks if the application is ready to serve traffic.
    If it fails, the pod is removed from Service endpoints, but not restarted.
    
    Use it when startup is slow or during temporary failures like DB reconnect.


3. Liveness Probe

    Purpose: Checks if the application is alive.
    If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container.
    
    Use it when your app can hang or get stuck.
    
    Example use case:
    App is running but not responding due to a deadlock.
