Ingress =
  Ingress is the Kubernetes way to manage external HTTP and HTTPS traffic and route it to services inside the cluster. 
  Think of it as a smart entry gate that decides where requests should go based on rules.

**Why Ingress is used
    Without Ingress, you usually expose apps using:
    NodePort: Opens ports on every node.
    LoadBalancer: Creates one cloud load balancer per service.

**Ingress solves this by:
    Using one load balancer
    Routing to multiple services
    Supporting path-based and host-based routing
    Handling TLS termination in one place


ingress.yml

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: app-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-service
            port:
              number: 80

Practicle = 
Default service LoadBalancer does not support path based routing that's why we are using ingress.

1. create path1.yml file and apply it --> kubectl apply -f path1.yml
2. create path2.yml file and apply it --> kubectl apply -f path2.yml
3. create ingress.yml file and apply it --> kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
4. In ingress file path is routed via service name 
5. for getting load balancer check command --> kubectl get ingress
6. copy the LoadBalancer and run on browser check application is running.
7. http://LB/nginx --> it redierects to niginx app
8. http://LB/httpd --> it redirects to httpd app
9. Now create route53 A type record, select alias option then select --> Alias to Network Load balancer then select region and select LB
10. Now create ingress-with-host.yml and apply it in this file add your host ip.
11. Now check your host to browser and check all path based routing.
