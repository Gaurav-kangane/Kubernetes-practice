RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) controls who can do what in your Kubernetes cluster.

1. Role =
    A Role in Kubernetes is an RBAC object that defines what actions are allowed on which resources inside a single namespace.

##Key points about a Role

    1.Namespace-scoped
    A Role works only in one namespace (like dev, qa, or default).
    
    2.Defines permissions only
    A Role does not give access by itself.
    Access is granted only when it is attached using a RoleBinding.
    
    3.Controls resources + actions
    You specify:
    
    4.Resources → pods, services, deployments, configmaps, etc.
      Verbs → get, list, create, update, patch, delete, watch


2. ClusterRole =
    A ClusterRole defines what actions are allowed on which resources across the entire cluster.
    It is not limited to a single namespace.

**Key points about ClusterRole

    1.Cluster-wide scope
      Works across all namespaces and also for cluster-level resources.
    
    2.Can access non-namespaced resources
      Example: nodes, namespaces, persistentvolumes, storageclasses.
    
    3.Permissions only
      Like Role, it does nothing alone.
      You must attach it using:
    
    4.ClusterRoleBinding (cluster-wide access)
      RoleBinding (namespace-limited access)
